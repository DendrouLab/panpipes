## Insallation of panpipes



##### Step 1 create virutal environment:

It is advisable to run everything in a virtual environment either pip or conda.

Using pip venv
Navigate to where you want to create your virtual environment  and follow the steps below to create a pip virtual environment
```

python3 -m venv --prompt=panpipes python3-venv-panpipes/
# This will create a panpipes/venv folder
```

activate the environment

```
source python3-venv-panpipes/bin/activate
```

**OR** using conda:
similarly to what suggested in https://www.biostars.org/p/498049/ we create a conda environment with R and python



```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
# you should remove the strict priority afterwards!
conda search r-base
conda create --name pipeline_env python=3.9 r-base=4.3.0
```
now we activate the environment
```
conda activate pipeline_env
```


##### Step 2 Download and install this repo
If you have not already set up SSH keys for github first follow these [instructions](https://github.com/DendrouLab/panpipes/docs/set_up_ssh_keys_for_github.md): 


```
git clone https://github.com/DendrouLab/panpipes
cd panpipes
pip install .
```

<!-- 
```
pip install git+https://github.com/DendrouLab/panpipes
``` -->

The pipelines are now installed as a local python package.


### Step 3 installing R requirements
The pipelines uses R for some ggplot visualisations and the interoperability components. 


If you are using a venv virtual environment,  the pipeline will call a local R installation, so make sure R is installed and install the required packages with the command we provide below.

We provide an Rscript with the R packages needed, please remember to customize the CRAN mirror selection in the first line of the script (or remove the line if you have already specified a CRAN mirror in your `.Rprofile`)
We advise installing `tidyverse` through conda like so

```
conda install -c conda-forge r-tidyverse
```

Then, from within the panpipes folder run:
 ```
 Rscript panpipes/R_scripts/install_R_libs.R
 ```
running with the option `--vanilla` or `--no-site-file` prevents R from reading your `.Renvironment` or `.Rprofile` in case you want to use different settings from you local R installation.

You can expect the installation of R libraries to take quite some time, this is not something related to `panpipes` but how R manages their libraries and dipendencies!
<!-- If you are using a conda virtual environment, R *and the required packages (check this)* will be installed along with the python packages.  -->

To check the installation was successful run the following line
```
panpipes --help
```
A list of available pipelines should appear!


### Step 4 pipeline configuration (for SGE or SLURM clusters)
*Note: You won't need this for a local installation of panpipes.*

Create a yml file for the cgat core pipeline software to read

```
vim ~/.cgat.yml
```

For SGE servers:
```
cluster:
  queue_manager: sge
  queue: short
condaenv:
```


For Slurm servers:
```
cluster:
    queue_manager: slurm
    queue: short
```

There are likely other options that relate to **your specific server**, e.g. 
These are added as 
```
cluster:
    queue_manager: slurm
    queue: short
    options: --qos=xxx --exclude=compute-node-0[02-05,08-19],compute-node-010-0[05,07,35,37,51,64,68-71]

```



See [cgat-core documentation](https://cgat-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/Cluster_config.html) for cluster specific additional configuration instructions.

Note that there is extra information on the .cgat.yml for Oxford BMRC rescomp users in [docs/installation_rescomp](https://github.com/DendrouLab/sc_pipelines/blob/master/docs/installation_rescomp.md)

### DRMAA library path


if `echo $DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH` does not return anything, add DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH to your bash environment (the line below is specific to the rescomp server)
You need to find the path to this libdrmaa.so.1.0 file on your server, ask your sys admin if you cannot find it!

```
PATH_TO_DRMAA = ""
echo "export DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH=$PATH_TO/libdrmaa.so.1.0" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Specifying Conda environments to run panpipes
If using conda environments, you can use one single one or create one for each of the workflows in panpipes, (i.e. one workflow = one environment) 
The environment (s) should be specified in the .cgat.yml global configuration file or in each of the single workflows pipeline.yml configuration files and it will be picked up by the pipeline as the default environment. 
Please note that if you specify the conda environment in the workflows configuration file this will be the first choice to run the pipeline. 



If no environment is specified, the default behaviour of the pipeline is to inherit environment variables from the node where the pipeline is run. However there have been reported issues on SLURM clusters where this was not the default behaviour. In those instances we recommend to add the conda environment param in the .cgat.yml file or in each of the pipeline.yml independently.

i.e. :

```

cluster:
    queue_manager: slurm
    queue: cpu_p
    options: --qos=xxx --exclude=compute-node-0[02-05,08-19],compute-node-010-0[05,07,35,37,51,64,68-71]
condaenv: /path/to/pipeline_env
```
or 

```
