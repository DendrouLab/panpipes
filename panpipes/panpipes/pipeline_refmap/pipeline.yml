# Pipeline pipeline_refmap.py configuration file
# ==============================================

# compute resource options
# ------------------------
# customize this depending on the cluster you're using
resources:
  # Number of threads used for parallel jobs
  # this must be enough memory to load your mudata and do computationally intensive tasks
  threads_high: 1
  # this must be enough memory to load your mudata and do computationally light tasks
  threads_medium: 1
  # this must be enough memory to load text files and do plotting, requires much less memory than the other two
  threads_low: 1
# path to conda env, leave blank if running native or your cluster automatically inherits the login node environment
condaenv:

# allows for tweaking which queues jobs get submitted to, 
# in case there is a special queue for long jobs or you have access to a gpu-sepcific queue
# the default queue should be specified in your .cgat.yml file
# leave as is if you do not want to use the alternative queues
queues:
  long: 
  gpu:

# query dataset
#----------------------
query: path_to_dataset
# we support raw10x formats, or preprocessed quality filtered mudata or anndata as input query
modality: rna
# if you supplied a mu data, specify the modality to be used
# currently only RNA query supported

# does your query data have a batch effect, what column?
# transform_batch term is only used in totalvi?
query_batch:
# does your query have a celltype annotation you want to use to compare to
# the transferred label?
# leave empty if not

# scvi tools params
#----------------------
# specify one or more reference models that you would like to use as reference
# you can use your own reference that you built using pipeline_integration here
# leave blank for no model specification

# specify the reference anndata/mudata with RNA. you need this only if you want to calc umap on both reference and query data.
# or leave blank and only provide model paths
reference_data: path_to_mudata 
# path to tovalvi saved model
totalvi: 
  - path_to_totalvi1

# Specify the full path to the model, i.e. Path/to/scanvi/model.pt
# if not running the method, remove the dummy - path_to_xxx and leave blank

# for scvi and totalvi, if the reference model has a trained random forest classifier, use to
# classify cells in the query

# training params
#----------------------

# to reuse these params, (for example for WNN) please use anchors (&) and scalars (*) in the relevant place
# i.e. &rna_neighbors will be called by *rna_neighbors where referenced

#----------------------
# neighbors params to calculate umaps on either query alone, or query+ reference dataset
#----------------------

neighbors: 
  # number of Principal Components to calculate for neighbours and umap:
  #   -if no correction is applied, PCA will be calculated and used to run UMAP and clustering on
  #   -if Harmony is the method of choice, it will use these components to create a corrected dim red.)

# wnn seurat params
#----------------------

wnn: path_to_wnn_h5
# instead to a path to a model, in wnn you have to provide a path to a seurat or mudata/anndata object with wnn integration precomputed
wnn_mapping_normalization: SCTransform, LogNormalize
# specify normalization to use for query data, same used to build reference wnn.
normalize: False
# if RNA is pre-normalized specify method above and set normalize to False
