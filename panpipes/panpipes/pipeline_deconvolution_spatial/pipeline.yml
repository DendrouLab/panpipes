resources:
  # Number of threads used for parallel jobs
  # this must be enough memory to load your mudata and do computationally intensive tasks
  threads_high: 2
  # this must be enough memory to load your mudata and do computationally light tasks
  threads_medium: 2
  # this must be enough memory to load text files and do plotting, requires much less memory than the other two
  threads_low: 1
# path to conda env, leave blank if running native or your cluster automatically inherits the login node environment

# Specify input 
# ----------------------

input_spatial:  # path to folder containing one or multiple mudatas of spatial data; in the mudatas, the spatial data is expected to be saved in mudata.mod["spatial"]
# for each spatial mudata, deconvolution is run with "input_singlecell" (see below) as a reference
input_singlecell: # path to mudata of reference single-cell data, reference data expected to be saved in mudata.mod["rna"]

  # Reduced feature set can either be given  a) via a csv file of genes or b) feature selection will be performed Ã  la Cell2Location, i.e. via the function: cell2location.utils.filtering.filter_genes()
  
  #  a) path to a csv file containing a reduced feature set
  gene_list: #a header in the csv is expected in the first row
  
  # b) parameters for Cell2Loc feature selection, leave empty to use defaults
  # whether to remove mitochondrial genes before feature selection 
  remove_mt: False # default True
  # all genes detected in less than cell_count_cutoff cells will be excluded.

  # all genes detected in at least this percentage of cells will be included.
  cell_percentage_cutoff2: #default 0.05, parameter of function cell2location.utils.filtering.filter_genes()
  # genes detected in the number of cells between the above-mentioned cutoffs are selected only when their average expression in non-zero cells is above this cutoff
