- Integration pipeline refactor
    - scope over different PCS input to integration
    - Make it modular
    - Write documentation to accompany it

- QC pipeline
    - Integrate general and cellranger  inputs

## High priority/Low urgency

- Unit testing/infrastructure to prevent future breaks!
- More integration metrics.
- Produce a final object, which pulls together all the data e.g. pipeline_final


## Low priority/High urgency

- Branch merging - neighbours arguments have separated out
- Integration - better visualisation
- Make it work on other servers/singularity box?
- Clustering: Remove R complex heatmap plot? Or fix memory usage.


## Low priority/Low urgency

- better name 
- consistent naming of vaariables.
- **nextflow**/snakemake
- more integration methods.
- compatible with mouse
    - requires parameter plus gene lists for QC4
- do we want to keep downsampling?
